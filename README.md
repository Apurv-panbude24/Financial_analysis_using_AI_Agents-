# Financial Analysis Project

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to analyze financial data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. It incorporates data retrieval from SEC filings, document embedding using `llama_index`, and AI-based query engines for financial analysis. The primary focus is on automating financial document processing, extracting insights, and evaluating financial trends.

## File Structure

### `financial_analysis.ipynb`
This notebook is structured into several key sections:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Checks the Python environment and installed packages.
   - Verifies dependencies, specifically for `llama_index` and related libraries.

2. **Importing Required Libraries**
   - Includes `llama_index` components for vector search and AI-based retrieval.
   - Uses `requests` to fetch financial data from the SEC.

3. **Fetching SEC Filings Data**
   - The notebook queries the SEC database to retrieve Appleâ€™s 10-K filings.
   - JSON data is processed to extract relevant financial document links.
   - Constructs URLs to access official SEC reports.

4. **Embedding Financial Data**
   - Uses `OpenAIEmbedding` to convert financial text data into vector representations.
   - Sets up AI-based indexing to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information.

5. **Query Engine and AI Agent**
   - Implements `QueryEngineTool` from `llama_index` for structured financial queries.
   - Uses `OpenAIAgent` to enhance financial document analysis.

6. **Results and Analysis**
   - The processed SEC filings are analyzed for financial trends.
   - The AI agent generates insights based on vectorized embeddings.

## Features

- Automated retrieval of SEC financial reports.
- AI-driven document embedding and search.
- Natural language financial query engine.
- Extraction of key insights from corporate filings.
- Potential for expansion into broader financial analysis.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial_analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd financial_analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Requirements
